STORY:

Once upon a time there was a good hund.
And that Hund had just eaten some Lederhose.
And he loved eating Gebaeck.
After eating, the hund went to Berlin.
In Berlin, he saw a big crowd at a beautiful Biergarten and trotted in.
The hund would have stayed outside with the lively crowd however it was quite a hot day and he was in dire need of some klimaanlage.
The hund thought about the Porshe he saw outside the baeckerei.
And thought it will be filled with Gebaeck.
Only to find out it filled with a Brot of dog treats.
The hund was so happy about the treats, he danced around to rock Musik!
I believe it was a Rammstein track.
I heard the track in a biergarten once before.
I remember it was at a beirgarten just outside of Raesfeld that was hosting a wettbewerbsfaehig karaoke night.
